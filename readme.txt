Basic idea of this project is monitor temperature in 2 different places inside apartment. 
- Express server is programmed on laptop and then deployed on Heroku 
- Temperature  will be measured by DHT11 and KY-028 sensors. After that, data will be sent to Express server
- Sending data is done by using POST request (or maybe other approaches). A simple front-end website will be designed to display these data
